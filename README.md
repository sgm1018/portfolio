## Why Astro?
Astro was chosen over other frameworks like React, Angular, and Next.js for its unique features that align perfectly with a **portfolio website**:
- **SEO Benefits**: Static site generation (SSG) ensures content is pre-rendered, boosting search rankings.
- **Faster Load Times**: Only ships essential JavaScript, unlike React or Angular which load large JS bundles.
- **SSR for Dynamic Content**: Allows fetching data dynamically without compromising performance.
- **Component Islands Architecture**: Uses only client-side interactivity where needed, keeping the site lightweight.
  
## Features
- **Blazing-Fast Performance**: Astro delivers static pages by default, ensuring rapid load times.
- **SEO Optimized**: Pre-rendered pages improve search engine visibility.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Ships only the necessary JavaScript to improve performance.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support**: Ideal for dynamic content while maintaining efficiency.
